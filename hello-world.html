 Hello World 
A program to greet the planet.

This page is an attempt to greet everyone on Earth using our various human languages.  We're interested to see how long our list can become.</p>

We'll start with languages that the Epicodus staff could offer without using Google. </p>

English: Hello, world!
Spanish:  Hola, mundo!
Japanese: Konnichiwa, sekai! 
French: Bonjour, monde!
Kinyarwanda: Mwirwe, isi!
